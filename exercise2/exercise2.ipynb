    "# Exercise 2 - Centrality\n",
    "Centrality is a key concept in social network analysis. It measures the importance or influence of a certain node/edge in a network. The interpretation of importance or influence, however, depends on the type of centrality and the application for which it is measured. Different types of centrality were discussed in the lecture: Degree Centrality, Closeness Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and Eigenvector Centrality.\n",
    "In this exercise, you are going to implement different centrality algorithms."
